# CPC-Course-2021
The course was divided into 9 topics and every one ended with homework (mostly one week to pass it)
and I will try to briefly describe them.

### I. Windows Forms Framework
The goal of this class was to learn have to create a simple and user-friendly UI using Windows Forms technology. As homework, we have to create a simple
game.

### II. Connect MS SQL with Windows Forms Application
Next topic consisted in create a simple relational database in MS SQL and connect it with Windows Forms Application. The functionality of the app was to
provide CRUD operations at one of the arrays in the database.

### III. Introduction to HTML, CSS and JS
The classes aimed to make a simple website without additional frameworks or libraries.

### IV. MVC Template (Model-View-Controller)
The goal was to create an MVC project in the ASP.NET Core Platform. As part of my homework, I have prepared a simple web application to study countries and capitals.

### V. Entity Framework
At this class we have prepared code describing relational database and migratedthis to MS SQL (code-first approach). As homework, we had to create a new MVC project and connect it with the prepared database.

### VI. WebAPI
This meeting aimed to construct a simple REST API that will include basic requests for example GET, POST, PUT and DELETE and document this in Swagger.

### VII. ReactJS (1)
This class was my first contact with React library. Based on the "TODO" app built during alecture I created the app to check the presence of participants at any event. We can sort them into three groups: all, present, absent and draw the person from any group.

### VIII. ReactJS (2)
At this class we have learned how to connect React applications with API.

### IX. Tests
At this meeting we have built simple tests for a few classes using xUnit (testing tool for .NET Framework Platform).
