# Laboratory 7 - React part 1
This project was my first contact with React library. Basing on the "TODO" app created during lecture I create the app to check presence of participants of any activity. We can sort them on the tree groups: all, present, absent. I think the nice feature is that we can draw the person from any group so we can easily find someone e.g. to respond :wink: 

## Features
 - adding persons
 - sort people on groups (all, present, absent)
 - draw a person from any group
 - check presence of activity members

P.S. I forgot about deleting persons... I'll do this in the near future :sweat_smile:
